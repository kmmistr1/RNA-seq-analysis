transcriptomic study in young and old Naked mole rat reveals its healthy longevity

Our analysis reveals the difference in the Differentially expressed genes in newborn, 4- and 20-years old H. glaber (Naked mole rat) that are linked to healthy ageing and longevity.
ANalysis involves 4 steps:
I. Quality check and control of the sample data sets in Linux.
II. Mapping of sample transcripts to two different reference transcripts Mus musculus and H glaber & Quantification of the gene counts mapped to the reference genomes in Linux.
III. Analysis of DEGs with the matrix produced from featureCounts step in R.
IV. Functional enrichment (Gene Ontology) of the genes expressed with significant p value using GOEA-analysis in Python.

We also performed gene ontology on web based interface DAVID tool (not shown here) and achieved similar output as GOEA analysis.
